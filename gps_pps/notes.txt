GPS Pulse Per Second Driver Notes
---------------------------------

The gps_pps driver handles the pulse per second output
of the GPS receiver.  The receiver raises its PPS output
for 100 msec when the UTC second changes.  The leading
edge of the PPS pulse coincides with the start of a new UTC second.

Gps_pps comes in the form of a kernel module. It is installed
by executing the install_gps_pps.sh script.  The script removes
old copies of the driver and /dev/gps_pps, installs the gps_pps
module and creates /dev/gps_pps.  Remove_gps_pps.sh uninstalls
the module and deletes /dev/gps_pps.

The gps_pps driver is accessed through /dev/gps_pps just like
any other driver.  See gps_pps.c for a description of the
facilities that it provides.


TS-7260 GPS PPS Hardware Setup
------------------------------
The PPS signal is connected to the TS-7260 through DIO_8.
DIO8 is pin 8 on the DIO1 header.
On the TS-7260, DIO_8 is connected to EP9302 processor
GPIO Port F, Bit 1 which is mapped to the Linux GPIO
number, EP93XX_GPIO_LINE_MCCD1.  The Linux GPIO interface
is used to control the the GPIO pin (direction, interrupts
etc.)  Gps_pps does not directly access the EP9302 hardware.

The Pseudo PPS signal output is on DIO_7 which is pin 15 on
the DIO1 header.
